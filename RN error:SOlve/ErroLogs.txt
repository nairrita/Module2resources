Reason: the problem may occur due to the firewall . 
Sol: Try to close any firewall , any antivirus. Disable the firewall for the 19001 port of your  IP address.
Sol: Try running on Tunnel Mode.



Final Solve:
just restart all devices:
That includes:
Your computer
Your phones
Your router
It solved.

Last solve:

 know your IPv4---> Type in the  terminal ip a and then search for the word inet and copy the sequence of numbers next to it. That is your IPv4.



Then enter the command sudo ufw allow from <your-IPv4> to any port <the-port>, for example: sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.100/24 to any port 19001. 
This will add a rule to the firewall configuration and should fix the issue.

After work done use it at your own risk and remember to delete the previously created rule when you finish working with Expo with the command 
sudo ufw delete allow from 192.168.0.100/24 to any port 19001, just for security reasons. 
To check all the configured rules and the status of the firewall: sudo ufw status.
